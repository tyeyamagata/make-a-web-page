				<h2>Lesson 1: Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>
				<div class="module">
					<h3>What is 'The Web?'</h3>
						<p><a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/World_Wide_Web.html">The Web</a> is network of computers sharing information. When your browser displays information on your screen, it's showing you the HTML file that a server sent via HTTP request.</p>

				<div class="module">
					<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
						<p>Hypertext Markup Language, or <a href="http://www.yourhtmlsource.com/starthere/whatishtml.html">HTML</a>, is a language used to create documents that control "what you see" and "how it looks" on the web.</p>

					<h3>What are "Tags" and "Elements?"</h3>
						<p><em>Elements</em> are the structure and content of what you see on a web page. <em>Tags</em> are used to define the elements to correctly apply properties and style. More information about tags and elements can be found <a href="http://webdesign.about.com/od/beginningtutorials/f/what-is-html-tag-or-element.htm">here</a>.</p>

				<div class="module">
				<h3>What are "Inline" and "Block" elements?</h3>
					<p><em>Inline</em> elements are usually text elements that are not effected by breaks or indentation unless specified. <em>Block</em> elements are separated by "invisible boxes" to give them space around other elements. More information about inline and block elements can be found <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp">here</a>.</p>

					<h3>What tools do Web Developers use?</h3>
						<p><em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em>, and <em>Javascript</em> are 3 basic tools commonly used to construct web pages. HTML is the language of the Web with a set of specific syntax and rules. CSS is the program used to add style. Style can affect the position, size, and color of elements. Finally, Javascript can change HTML content, HTML attributes, CSS style, and can validate input.</p>

				<div class="module">
					<h3>What is Webpage Structure?</h3>
						<p><em>Structure</em> is used to organize code to make it easier for humans to understand and read. First of all it is important to note that not all elements are visible from the browser. Some elements are used to help read the code like a map. All elements are, however, rectangular. Everything you see in a webpage is contained within a box indicating the element's boundaries. At first glance structure can be very simple. It is possible to dig deeper into the layers of each webpage element and find that the structure branches off much like a tree.</p>

					<div class="module">
						<h3>What is "The Box Model?"</h3>
							<p><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp">The Box Model</a> is used in developer tools to visually display an element and its dimensions. It consists of margins, borders, padding, and the content of the element. </p>

						<h3>What is the most important thing to avoid when writing code?</h3>
							<p>Avoid <em>repetition</em>! Errors most frequently occur in repeated instances of the same code where minor changes are made. If you're not <em>consistant</em>, those errors can lead to malfunctioning code. It's best to keep things as simple as possible to avoid these mistakes.</p>
					</div>

				<div class="col-12">
					<div class="module">
						<h3>What is CSS?</h3>
							<p>Cascading Style Sheets, or <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp">CSS</a>, control the style of HTML elements. By using tags, the CSS gives style to all elements of the same class-type.</p>
